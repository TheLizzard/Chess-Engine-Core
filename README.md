# Chess-Engine-Core
The core of my chess engine.

# Compiling and Running:
Compiling and running `alphabeta.cpp` will create a `main` function that should be called with 1 parameter: the string of the fen position.

# Notes:
This isn't a stand alone program. This is a simple chess library with alpha-beta pruning.
